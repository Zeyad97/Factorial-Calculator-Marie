# MARIE Factorial Calculator 🧮

A simple **Factorial Calculator** built using **MARIE Assembly Language** as part of the *Computer Architecture* course.

## 📌 Description

This project demonstrates how to calculate the factorial of a number using **loops**, **memory manipulation**, and **basic arithmetic** in the MARIE architecture.

## 📂 Files Included

- `factorial.mas` – MARIE Assembly code to compute factorial
- `README.md` – Project info and usage

## 💡 How it works

The program:
1. Takes an input number from the user
2. Uses a loop to multiply values in decreasing order
3. Stores and displays the result

> 📚 Built as a university assignment and extended for learning purposes.
